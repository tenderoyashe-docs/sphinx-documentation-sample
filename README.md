# Sphinx Documentation Sample

This repository demonstrates a basic structured documentation project using reStructuredText and a Sphinx-style layout.

It includes:
- index.rst
- Table of contents (toctree)
- Structured headings
- Code blocks
- Cross-referencing examples

This sample reflects documentation written for developer-facing or technical product environments.
